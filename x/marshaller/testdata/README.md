Unfortunately I don't remember where I got the stereo_calib images from.
img1 and img2 are a few images from kitti odometry dataset.
mnist model is something freely circulated on github, but I forgot where I fetched it.

If someone recognizes where these tesetdata files originate from - please let me know. 
I'll be replacing them in some distant future with my own. But I wish I could give credit to the authors...
